### Hello!

My name is Thomas, I'm currently a senior computer vision engineer at <a href="https://www.modalai.com">ModalAI</a>. Right now I'm really focused on work that involves using clever hardware optimizations to speed up traditional vision tasks but am more broadly interested in ML, robotics, and embedded programming. 

Below you'll find some of the independent projects I've worked on. If anything strikes your interest, don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:tjpatton1@gmail.com).

If you're more curious about me, checkout my [personal website](https://thomaspttn.github.io) or my [blog](https://thomaspatton.substack.com).
